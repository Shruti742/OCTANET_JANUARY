I recently created a Spotify Clone project to enhance my front-end development skills. This project focuses on building a responsive music streaming UI similar to Spotify using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling.

Key Features:
Sidebar Navigation: A sleek sidebar with icons and links for quick access to "Home," "Search," and "Your Library." The sidebar has a dark theme, aligning with the Spotify design.

Main Content Layout: The page displays music content in a card-style layout, including:

Recently played music.
Trending tracks and albums.
Featured charts.
Each card has an image, title, and description to showcase the playlists, albums, or songs.

Sticky Navigation Bar: A sticky top bar that stays visible during scrolling, offering quick access to premium features, a user profile icon, and app installation options.

Music Player: A fixed bottom player with controls like play/pause, skip, and volume. The player stays at the bottom of the screen as the user navigates the page, creating a seamless experience.

Responsive Design: Using media queries, the layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring the design is mobile-friendly while maintaining functionality on desktop.
